h1. Important: If you follow these instructions then %{color:red}changes in Eclipse = changes in the git folder!%

h1. If you are uncomfortable, try this with the test repository at git@git.assembla.com:testcs230g7.git

h3. Steps:

# Clone the repository anywhere on your PC
# Start Eclipse
# Clipboard01
# Clipboard02
# Clipboard03: @if@ that thing pops up just press OK
# Clipboard04: a new section appears in the lower left part of the Eclipse window
# Clipboard05: hit browse
# Clipboard06: browse to the location of where you cloned the repo in step 1
# Clipboard07: hit search
# Clipboard08
# Clipboard09: that's a right click on the item in the @Git Repositories@ section
# Clipboard10
# Clipboard11
# Clipboard12: a different look is fine too

h3. Understand:

* Whatever you change in Eclipse, it will change the git folder as well
* You still must @push@ from the git folder, Eclipse didn't want to do it for me in my case
* You can @commit@ from within Eclipse if you want to, I still recommend you do it from the git folder
* If the git folder changes, Eclipse should update the imported project automatically or complain it's not up to date with the file system (quick F5 fixes it)
* @Commit@ and @push@ as often as possible. If you build up alot of commits and then @push@, there is a possibility of a bad merge due to very outdated code.
* Always @pull@ before starting to work and before committing.
